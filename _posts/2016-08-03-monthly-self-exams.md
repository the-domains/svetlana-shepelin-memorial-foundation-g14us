  About 1 in 8 (12%) women in the US will develop invasive breast cancer during
  their lifetime. While various comprehensive screening guidelines exist, they
  focus on women in their 40's and 50's. In 4.5% of cases, cancer is diagnosed
  in women younger than 40 years old, including cases in young women in their
  teens and twenties. While your chances of developing breast cancer in your
  teens and twenties are low, developing a habit of doing a monthly self exam
  starting in your teens will give you the best chance of catching the disease
  early and having the best chance of beating the disease.
